## About The Project

Tenflix is content-recommendation engine that displays the top 10 most similar titles based on the plot, cast, genre, and directors of your favorite Netflix title. The recommendations were calculated on a dataset containing details of over 7000 different titles.

This repository contains the files for the frontend part of Tenflix and the recommendation engine, built with Python, can be found [here](https://github.com/outoflaksh/Plot-Based-Netflix-Recommendation).
